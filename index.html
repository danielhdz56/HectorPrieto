                            <p>Strategic Interventions like to follow a master template for creating change called the Seven Master Steps. This is a sequence refined by Tony over the years for making sure that you fully understand the person and they feel
                                understood, so that you can direct them through the actions and experiences that will create lasting change. SI is a very active and strategic approach to coaching, where you actually give the person a short, easy task
                                to do that will create massive changes for them. For instance, the way Tony is inviting Tahnee to “put herself in depression” is actually permanently altering the way Tahnee will experience depression in the future (i.e.,
                                she won’t have it anymore.)

                            <h5 class="text-center">Life Stages.</h5>
                            <p>Why do some coaching methods fail – leading to a quick “pump up” followed by a loss of momentum… while Strategic Interventions create permanent change where people not only help themselves, but then turn around to help others?
                                The focus of Strategic Intervention is to create a processional effect – where the person who previously needed help now becomes the helper, like ripples expanding on a pond. You see, every moment of your life, every decision
                                you make is influenced by the way you meet what we call your Six Human Needs. This is a universal way to understand anyone in your life – especially yourself. If you can understand and create a change in your human needs,
                                you transform your life (guaranteed.) The second factor is understanding life stages. You see, life is made up of a series of life stages, which require a whole new way of being. If you can understand and manage your stage
                                in life, you’ll trigger a whole new level of growth.

                            <p>Lasting change is rooted in our needs to grow and to contribute beyond ourselves. Raise your standards in any area of life, and soon you’ll be looking around to see whom you can help. And that’s the next level for you. Now
                                that we’ve gone through the Six Human Needs, we’re going to see how by understanding her needs and the way she has been using them, Tahnee made a conscious choice that transformed her life, career, relationship… you name
                                it. And as we visit with Tahnee several years later, you’ll see how by making a commitment to growth and contribution, Tahnee found herself not only prospering but becoming a leader and a positive example… even to her mother.</p>
